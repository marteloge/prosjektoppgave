  When a new password scheme are proposed, there are several aspects of password that needs to be considered. A password scheme needs to be secure in terms of entropy, it needs to be hard to guess and it also needs to be easy to use. This section will give a brief introduction to the history of research published on graphical passwords. This is important to know because each scheme is trying to improve different aspects of graphical password, giving us a detailed understanding of todays situation. 

  The idea of graphical passwords was originally described by Greg Blonder in 1996 \cite{Blonder}. The graphical password scheme porposed was requireing the users to tap on a selection of points on a predefined image in order to pass the authentication process. This was just a proposal, and did not further explore the power of graphical passwords, nor analysed the security aspects of the proposal. 

  In 1999, Jermyn et al. \cite{Jermyn} suggested a new graphical password scheme called ``DAS'' (Draw-a-secret). Draw-A-Secret (DAS) was the first recall-based graphical password scheme proposed. The motivation for the graphical password scheme was that graphical input devices enables the user to decouple the position of inputs from the temporal order in which they occur, and shows that the decoupling can be used to genereate passwords that have a larger and more memorable password space. In order to make a more memorable password, the research group argumented that the DAS was more secure than text-based passwords because the users were able to remember longer and more complex passwords. 

  In 2000, Dhamija and Perrig \cite{DejaVu},created a new password scheme called ``Deja Vu''. The password scheme was based on the hash visualization technique \cite{HashVisualization}. The users are asked to select a sequence of images from a random set of images that are generated by a program. They wanted to make a graphical password scheme that solved some of the shortcomings with recall-based authentication like PIN's and text-based passwords. Deja vu should purly rely on recognition rather than recall, and it should be hard to write down and share the password with others. The randomly generated pictures based on the hash visualization technique makes it hard to share the password since the pictures is hard to recreate, but are easy to remember. 

  ``Passfaces'' is a graphical password scheme developed by Real User Corporation that was founded in 2000 \cite{passface}. The authentication procedure allows the users to first select four images that are a visualization on human faces, and the user get authenticated by identifying their four faces. The scheme exploits the advantage that people are good at recognizing people, so when users choose the human faces, they can recognice the characteristics of the faces.

  In 2002, Goldberg et al. \cite{PassDoodle} tried to make a graphical password scheme that combined both text an images called ``PassDoodle''. This is a graphical password combined of handwritten text. Their study concluded that users were able to remember complete doodle images as accurately as text-based passwords. 

  In 2005 Wiedenbeck and Blonder made a graphical password scheme called ``PassPoints'' \cite{PassPoints} that is an  extension of the Blonder's \cite{Blonder} idea by eliminating the boundaries and allowing arbitrary images to be used. They evaluated their password scheme by testing the scheme on human users. The results showed that PassPoint were a promising scheme with respect to memorability becuase of the low error rate and low clicking rate. 
  The aim of this study was to get an understanding of how different images affected userr performance in authentication with a graphical password sceme. The priliminary result showed suggested that images may support memorability in graphical password schems. 

  In 2006, a research wanted to adress the problem with graphical passwords and the shoulder suring problem. They called their password scheme ``Convex Hull Click'' (CHC) \cite{Wiedenbeck} that allows the user to prove knowledge of the graphical password in secure and insecure location becuase they made the scheme in a way that users dont directly click on their password images, making it hard for attackers to do perform shoulder surfing. In CHC the windows shows a list of small icons. In the authentication process, the user needs to recognice some minimum number of their chosen password images, or ``pass-icons'', out of a large number of randomly places icons. This step are presented in a sequence, and if the user responds correctly every time, the user pass the authentication.
  
  In 2007, Tao and Adams \cite{Tao}, created a new proposal for a new graphical password scheme called ``Pass-Go''. The Pass-Go scheme is inspired by the old chinese game, Go, where users selects intersections on a grid to maker their password. This was one of the first largest user studies on graphical passwords, and was made in order to improve the usability of graphical passwords. They try to emphasise that the usability of a graphical password scheme will increase the memorability of graphical password, causing the password scheme to be more secure.
