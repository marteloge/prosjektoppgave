  \section{Research Question and Deliverables}
    
    {\bf RQ1: What is the status of current research on graphical passwords?} \\

    To answer my research question, a litterature review on graphical passwords will be conducted. The results from the litterature review will provide an overview of remaining research on graphical passwords that further will be analysed. The aim of this study is to find further research on graphical passwords that have not yet been answerd. 

    The final deliverable will be a complete research design that will be used in my master thesis the following spring. The research design will be a full design of the research process that will include main research questions, research strategy, data generation methods, and type of data analysis.

  \section{Limitations}

    The aim of this thesis is to design a research within a problem domain of graphical passwords that not have been answerd yet. This have been solved by conducting a ad-hoc litterature review. Due to the choice of ad-hoc instead of a structured litterature review may impact the results in the litterature that is found.
