  \section{Research Questions and Goals}
  The aim of this project is to design a user study for collecting graphical passwords set by different user types that further will be used in my master thesis the following spring. In the user study it will be collected graphical passwords, as well as information about the users creating the passwords. Before designing the user study, this thesis will include a detailed state-of-the-art study on graphical passwords. In order to understand human factors that may impacts users choice of graphical password, this thesis will also include a study of the psychological aspects that connects humans and passwords.

    \subsection*{Research Questions}
    {\bf RQ1: What is the status of current research on graphical passwords? } \\
    Research are always moving forward with new hypothesises and new results in the field. In order to do a research is imortant to know the relevant work as well as avoid answearing questions that already have been aswered. The result from is a detailed state-of-the-art study on graphical passwords.
    
    {\bf RQ2: What human factors may affect our choice of passwords?} \\
    Passwords are human-chosen secrets that are only connected to you as a person. When the secret are created you might create a password that are a association to something you know or recognice; passwords are more than just words and numbers. It is important to study the bias introduced in the password making process that can be a cause of human factors. Psychology are a field of study that might can give a understanding of how we think and give an explanation of why we make the choices that we do. The results is a part of the state-of-the-art study on graphical passwords. 
    
    {\bf RQ3: How should an user study to collect graphical passwords set by varoius user types be designed?} \\
    It is important to consider the biases that can be introduced as a cause of the design of user study. The design needs to consider what data that needs to be collected and how the data should be collected. It is also important to consider the diversity of the data in order to be able to get good resluts from the analysis. The result will be a detailed design on the user study that will be conducted in the following spring.
