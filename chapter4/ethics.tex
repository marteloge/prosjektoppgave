\section{Ethical Considerations}
\label{sec:ethical}

    In this section the ethics of this research will be discussed. 

    My research is done by collecting demographics and personal data, as well as asking the respondents to enter three selected patterns. Before doing research it is important to look into the ethical aspects to see if the data collected is legal and protect the personal data being anonymous. 

    Before the questionnaire starts, the respondents are informed about the purpose of the research and how their contributed data will be used. Respondents also must be informed that they have the right not to participate. The questionnaire should be fully anonymous and their identity and location should not be possible to track back to the respondent. 

    The demographic information collected do not provide any information that make it possible to track the data back to the respondent. It is still needed to apply for allowance to conduct this research because of collecting personal information. It is not desired to conduct unethical research. This will further be described in the next Chapter for future work.
